**1. How do I approach designing Software?**
   - **What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
      <br>I've learned how textures and lighting can affect an object in the smallest ways.  I little bit of specular lighting can wash out an entire scene and make it unreadable.
   - **What design process did you follow for your project work?**
      <br>Some items within the scene are complex which require multiple primitive shapes.  For example, the coffee mug is two cylinders and a torus.  Understanding what makes up the object as a whole was very important process within design.
   - **How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
      <br>I learned to work in smaller pieces and make sure one piece is working before adding a new feature.

**2. How do I approach developing programs?**
   - **What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
      <br>I learned how to use the export template function within Visual Studio.  By exporting the previous week's assignment, I was able to successfully build off it each week and add new features.
   - **How did iteration factor into your development?**
      <br>Starting from the very beginning with a basic set of 2D triangles, I was able to add new features each week, building on previous successes.

   - **How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led to your project's completion?**
      <br>I learned to make smaller changes, build, and continue as opposed to trying to do everything at once.  It was easier to debug and I was able to focus better.

**3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
   - **How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational and professional pathway?**
      <br>My Computer Science concentration is Data Analysis.  There are a lot of visualizations within data, so OpenGL may be useful.
